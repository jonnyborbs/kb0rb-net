I come from a long line of hams going back generations and am proud to carry on the family tradition, combining technology and communication with the fun of meeting new people. I'm a member of the ARRL as well as the Vaca Valley Radio Club (VVRC, https://w6vvr.net) and Sac Valley Mesh (https://www.sacvalleymesh.com) and got my FCC Amateur Extra in 2025.

I'm always looking to chat with new folks and learn new things so if you see me, say hi!

I send eQSLs and haven't yet gotten physical ones made yet. But I hope to soon!
